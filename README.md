#TACO CLI - Kendo UI Blank Project Template

A cross platform mobile device application developed with Kendo UI Core. 

This is a blank template that provides the Kendo UI Core framework files and the references for development with the framework to be used with TACO CLI.

#Usage
Creating a new app

    taco create helloWorld --template https://github.com/lohithgn/vs-taco-kendoui-blank-tmpl.git

Before running the app, execute the following commands

	npm install
	gulp

And your Hybrid Mobile App with Kendo UI Mobile Framework will be ready.

This template as the name goes, will be blank. It just puts the Kendo UI Mobile framework related files. It creates a Kendo UI Page which will be blank. You can take it over from here.
